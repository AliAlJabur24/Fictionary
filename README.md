# Fictionary
Our project consists of building an interactive web based game, where we will have a host and a limited number of clients (similar to Kahoot, or a Jackbox game). This game will  be multiplayer game similar to Pictionary but with a twist. 

There is an artist who receives a word to draw. The other players are tasked with coming up with ‘fake answers’ of what the picture being drawn is in order to throw off their competition. The players will then have to select an answer for what the drawing is, where the options are the  (player made) fake answers and the single, true, answer (given by the game). If the real answer is chosen, the artist receives points. If the fake answer is chosen, the author of the fake answer receives points. To win, you must either flex your art skills or lie convincingly.
